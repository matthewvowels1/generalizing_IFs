# generalizing_IFs
The notebooks in this repo are implementations of a series of examples from https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4342 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00681


The notebooks in this repo are: 

- *ATE-NN.ipynb* -> Demonstrates IF bias reduction with a neural network estimator approach to estimating the Average Treatment Effect
- *ATE.ipynb* -> Demonstrates IF bias reduction with a logistic regression estimator approach to estimating the Average Treatment Effect
- *conditional_expectation_tutorial.ipynb* -> Demonstrates  IF bias reduction with linear regression estatimor approach to estimating a conditional expectation with discrete conditiong variables.
- *k-fold_conditional_expectation.ipynb* -> Extends the above example to the k-fold CV case
- *generalising_IFs_autograd_tutorial.ipynb* -> Demonstrates IF bias reduction for estimating the Shannon Entropy.
- *generalising_IFs_autograd_tutorial-SIMS.ipynb* -> Extends the above example to bootstrapped/simulation case
